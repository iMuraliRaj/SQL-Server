Sorting :
 1. We can sort the result value by using ORDER BY clause.
 2. We can do both Ascending and Descending order of the data

Syntax:
SELECT 
    select_list
FROM
    table_name
ORDER BY 
    column_name | expression [ASC | DESC ];
 
Example:
 Select * from Employee order by EmployeeID ASC/DESC


3. We can sort the result by multiple columns
 Select * from Employee order by EmployeeID, EmployeeName 



Note:
  For, Ascending order we no need to specify the expression.
  By default it is assigned as Ascending order.
