The SQL WHERE Clause:

   1. The WHERE clause is used to filter records.
   2. It is used to extract only those records that fulfill a specified condition.
   
Note: 

   The WHERRE clause is not only used in SELECT statements, it is also used in UPDATE, DELETE, etc.
  


Syntax:

   SELECT ColumnName FROM TableName WHERE condition;
   
Example:
   
   Select * from Employee where EMPID='ATE186'



Text Fields vs. Numeric Fields:

   SQL requires single quotes around text values (most database systems will also allow double quotes).

   However, numeric fields should not be enclosed in quotes:
   
   SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE CustomerID=1;
